### A bit about this project

This project was my first entry into FOSS and programming/coding overall.

It has been very fun and also frustrating.

If you do find unoptimized code and or flaws or other inherently bad code - I would be very happy to merge changes and
try to learn from my own mistakes. Commenting the code helps! I will try to do so as well.
