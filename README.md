**Note:** 
By default the role that excludes users is currently called `Nadeko-excluded`. It can be changed in `./config.js`.              
It will autocreate the role if it doesnt exist first time you type `+exlude`. And as long as it has "Manage roles" permissions.

# About
### A bit about this project
This bot was my first entry into javascript, nodejs, discordjs and programming/coding overall. It has been very fun and also frustrating. If you do find unoptimized code and or flaws or other inherently bad code - I would be very happy to merge changes and try to learn from my own mistakes. Commenting the code helps! I will try to do so as well.

Update: Learning TypeScript has been a very good experience.
